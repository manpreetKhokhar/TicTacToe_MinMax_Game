# TicTacToe.cpp
This has the main driver program. 

It creates a MainGame's game object and calls its gamePlay() function. This launches the actual game
environment. 

The MainGame's object gamePlay() deals with creating game environment and initializing all the necessary variables.
This function also deals with the user interaction which is needed to play the game.

It prompts user for next move , check the victory 
of the player, declare the winner(if there is),declare tie (if there is), switches the turn of the players(if none of them has won yet).
